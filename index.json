Large stablecoin issuers do not pay interest, but investors can lend stablecoins in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending protocols, where interest rates are governed by predetermined interest rate rules enforced by smart contracts. This leads to markedly different interest rates between conventional short-term rates and stablecoins' interest rates. We first document that the recent Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle coincided with falling stablecoin interest rates until July 2022, after which the correlation became positive. To make sense of the observed dynamics, we develop a simple model of DeFi lending and bring it to the data. The model successfully reproduces the observed shift in monetary policy transmission to stablecoin rates.","tags":null,"title":"DeFi-ying the Fed?

In July 2022, when the ECB increased its policy rates by 50bp for the first time in a decade, rates of repo transactions collateralized by the scarcest bonds increased by only 30bp.

By keeping the borrowed funds on their central bank accounts at -0.5%, banks can earn a 50 basis points profit, a significant margin by money market standards.
