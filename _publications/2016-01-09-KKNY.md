excerpt: 'Using new data on security-level portfolio holdings by investor type and for all countries
in the euro area, we study portfolio rebalancing during the European Central Bank’s
(ECB) purchase programme that started in March 2015. To quantify changes in risk
concentration, we estimate the evolution of the distribution of duration, government,
and corporate credit risk exposures across investor sectors and regions until the last
quarter of 2017. Using these micro data, we show that among all investors, most of
the ECB purchases are sold by non-euro area investors, and we do not fnd evidence
that risks get concentrated in certain sectors or geographies. We estimate a sector-level
asset demand system using instrumental variables to connect the dynamics of portfolio
rebalancing to asset prices. Our estimates imply that government yields declined by
63bp, on average, and the estimates range from -37bp to -77bp across countries.'
