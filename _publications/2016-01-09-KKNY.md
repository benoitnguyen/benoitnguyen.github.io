excerpt: 'Using new data on security-level portfolio holdings by investor type and across countries in
the euro area, we study portfolio rebalancing during the European Central Bank’s (ECB)
purchase programme that started in March 2015. To quantify changes in risk
concentration, we estimate the evolution of the distribution of duration, sovereign, and
corporate credit risk exposures across investor sectors and geographies. We find that 70%
of ECB purchases are sold by the foreign sector and that risk mismatch, if anything,
reduces. We use an instrumental variables estimator to show that the average impact on
yields was -13bp. We connect the portfolio rebalancing and price effects by estimating a
sector-level asset demand system for government debt.
