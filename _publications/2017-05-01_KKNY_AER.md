excerpt: 'We use new granular data on institutional investors portfolio holdings to asses the rebalancing channel at play in response to the ECB asset purchase program. The holdings of eligible government bonds have strong home bias not only for banks but also for insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds, especially in the vulnerable countries. In response to the program, foreign investors sold most of the purchase-eligible government bonds. Banks also sold purchase-eligible government bonds to a lesser extent, but insurance companies and pension funds bought them. Thus, quantitative easing may have reduced the duration mismatch for these institutions.'

We use new and comprehensive data on the security holdings of euro-area investors to document facts 
about the ongoing quantitative easing program. The holdings of purchase-eligible government bonds have 
strong home bias not only for banks but also for insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds, 
especially in the vulnerable countries. In response to the program, foreign investors sold most of
the purchase-eligible government bonds. Banks also sold purchase-eligible government bonds to a lesser extent, 
but insurance companies and pension funds bought them. Thus, quantitative easing may have reduced the duration
mismatch for these institutions.
